# Amazon UI Clone

This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon website UI, created to practice and improve my HTML, CSS, and responsive design skills. The goal of this project is to replicate the look and feel of Amazon’s homepage, including the navigation bar, product sections, header, and footer.

The website is fully responsive and works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. This project helped me understand layout structuring, styling components, and deploying a static website using GitHub Pages.
